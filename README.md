# weather-application
A simple weather application using the openweather API. I have build the simple weather App using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This app helps to check the weather for your current location. It keeps you informed about conditions including temperature, rain and snow. You can clone this package and follow the steps below to use the app.

Steps to Clone and Open

1. Clone this package
2. Run the demo in live server from Visual Studio Code.
3. As you try to minimize the weather app screen the background color will change to lightblue.

As for my project features:

1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
2. Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and displayed about it in your app.
3. Convert user input between two formats and display the result. (e.g. Farenheight to Celcius)
4. Retrive data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
